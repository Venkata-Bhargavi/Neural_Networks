# Neural_Networks

To simulate mcculloch pitts neuron
In main.py change input patterns if required and run `python main.py` in terminal or run the main.py file in IDE like PyCharm

## Output:

Note: 
- Threshold is hard coded at this point but can be modified or randomly generated. If required, you can try with multiple thresholds during training process
- Bias input pattern is not mentioned explicitely as it is considered "1" in general and multiplying the weight with "1" would generate same result
